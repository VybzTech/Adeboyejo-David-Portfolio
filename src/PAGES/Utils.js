        After barely three weeks of my internship at a company, I claimed to
        have finished all the necessary front-end development coursework when my
        mentor gave me the assignment for the <b>Division Report Form.</b> I had
        completed a course from <b>Travesy</b>, watched and practiced some of
        <b>
          Angela Yu's fundamental Html, CSS, and Javascript tutorials on YouTube
        </b>
        , and perused the entirety of the <b>W3schools</b> library in the hopes
        that I would have learned enough to build a fully functional website.
        After experiencing some problems with Validation, I rapidly grew
        acclimated to <b>Jquery</b>, which helped with several javascript
        techniques. This led to the discovery of other libraries that improved
        my progress. I overcame my anxiety of javscript at this point by
        returning to my earlier grasp of variables, arrays, methods, objects,
        and classes, among other fundamental concepts. All of which come in
        handy till date. <br /> If you access the project, you will see the
        loading page, which needed a significant amount of CSS style and was, to
        put it mildly, time demanding. The project's design was supported by the
        use of <b>Bootstrap</b>, which wasn't a particularly challenging attempt
        for me since I've always been a designer. A user interface <b>(UI) </b>
        example was also given to me, but the designs had to be tweaked to
        adhere to specific rules. <br /> After the loading screen fades away,
        various form fields are displayed. These fields are marked with an
        asterisk (*) to indicate that certain values are necessary for the user
        to proceed with the form. Before moving on to the next page, a function
        that verifies the value of the mandatory field is not empty is called
        when the next button is clicked. You can try filling out some
        information and seeing what happens; the project is presently hosted on
        the <b>Netlify platform. </b>
        However, your information doesn't go anywhere, and you have the option
        of editing it afterwards.

        Expanding a team within an organization can put a significant burden on
        time management. However, this process could be made easier if the
        management had easy access to the information related to the projects.
        Keeping this in mind, I was assigned to work alongside three of my
        colleagues in order to develop a website that would analyze and present
        data for team assignments. The objective was to utilize graph
        representation, and this is where <b>Chart JS</b> became an integral
        part of my work. Initially, I was unsure about the idea of converting
        something that is readily available on other application toolsets like
        <b> Excel</b>. Nevertheless, I accepted the task and we coordinated
        ourselves to plan and execute the project. <br /> We were able to design
        a user-friendly interface that allowed users to input their team
        assignment data. This data was then processed and analyzed using
        <b> Chart JS</b>, a JavaScript library that enables the creation of
        interactive and visually appealing charts and graphs, additionally we
        had chart varieties like <b>Bar charts</b>, <b>Line charts</b>,
        <b> Pie charts</b>, to decide from whilst modifying colors, labels,
        tooltips, and other visual elements .
        <br />I was given the responsibility of handling the data storage aspect
        while my colleagues focused on the design and overall frontend
        development. Meanwhile, the last team member was in charge of preparing
        the presentation documents. On this faithful day, I started learning
        about <b>Php</b> and <b>Http Request</b>, specifically how to send{" "}
        <b>POST</b> and <b>GET API requests</b>. During this process, I also
        came across a new technique called
        <b> Ajax</b>. Despite facing numerous challenges and obstacles, we
        eventually succeeded in building the platform. However, we encountered
        an issue when trying to upload it to <b>Heroku</b>. Nevertheless, I have
        created a mockup that provides an overview of the entire project
        presentation, so you can take a look but remember, Dont Touch !

        In 2021, I elevated my career as a junior frontend developer with a
        basic understanding of website technology. As I delved deeper into the
        field, I encountered <b>React JS</b>, a library for dynamic and
        interactive interfaces that allows for the integration of various tech
        stacks, libraries, and tools. To enhance my skills in <b>React</b>, I
        enrolled in a course offered by <b>Netninja</b> that covered the
        fundamentals of the <b>React library.</b> Armed with this knowledge, I
        began exploring other aspects of web development, particularly focusing
        on <b> APIs. </b>With my newfound understanding of <b>APIs</b>, I
        decided to utilize a movie API to create a replica of a popular
        streaming service, known as<b> Netflix.</b>
        <br />
        <b>Netflix </b>was founded early in 1997 by
        <b> Reed Hastings</b> and <b>Marc Randolph</b> in
        <b> Scotts Valley, California</b> as a <i>DVD-by-mail</i> service;
        Nevertheless, as of this moment <b> Netflix </b>
        offers a vast collection of movies, TV shows, documentaries, and
        original content to its users. The company's recommendation algorithm,
        which analyzes user preferences and viewing habits, is a key feature
        that sets it apart. To mimic this feature, I built an API using the
        <b> DMDB movie API</b> and styled my components to resemble Netflix's
        dominant presence in the entertainment industry.

        A mobile application is not just about aesthetics; it also needs to
        perform advanced functions based on user interactions. This involves
        writing code that handles various user inputs and triggers appropriate
        responses. For example, if a user taps on a button, the application
        should be programmed to execute a specific action or display relevant
        information. Implementing these advanced functions requires a deep
        understanding of programming concepts and proficiency in using
        frameworks like <b>Flutter.</b> <br />
        During the <b>COVID-19</b> period in 2020, I took advantage of my free
        time and boredom by immersing myself in learning <b>Dart</b> through the
        <b> Flutter framework.</b> As the saying goes,
        <i> "Curiosity killed the cat", </i>but I was determined to explore new
        avenues and expand my knowledge. With the boredom that came with
        isolation lockdown, I decided to delve into the fascinating world of
        <b> Dart programming language</b> and the <b>Flutter framework, </b>
        utilizing the resources available on <b>Flutter.Dev</b> online library.
        Setting up an Andriod Emulator and designing the App's basic layout were
        crucial steps in creating a mobile application, followed by implementing
        advanced functions based on user interactions. After experiencing a
        significant amount of confusion and chaos, I managed to develop a simple
        application for managing tasks, commonly known as a <b>Todo App. </b>
        This app allows users to create and store their todos in organized
        classes, which include information such as the task name, priority
        level, due date, and even subtasks. To make it easily accessible to
        others, I compiled the app into an APK file and made it available for
        download on my
        <b> GitHub repository.</b>

        For my second gallery project, I initially embarked on a relatively
        straightforward journey but as I began, reverting to my design skills on
        <b> Adobe XD</b> I engaged the client to gather information about their
        preferences and requirements on the website's interface. Based on this
        input, I proceeded to design a user interface (UI) that would cater to
        their specific needs. To implement the UI, I utilized React JS, a
        JavaScript library c ommonly used for building dynamic user interfaces.
        <br />
        Upon the initial deployment of the website using React JS, the
        Photographer Ponle Oluwagbenga Richard expressed some dissatisfaction
        with it's optimization and identified several changes he desired to be
        made. To address Richard's concerns, I carefully reviewed his feedback
        and analyzed the existing code of the website. By identifying areas that
        required improvement, I was able to devise a plan for enhancing the
        optimization & implementation of the website and resolved to rebulding
        the project with the React Framework that enables developers to create
        full-stack Web applications by extending the latest React
        functionalities. This involved making adjustments to the HTML structure,
        ensuring proper semantic markup, optimizing elements by minimizing
        unnecessary code and reducing file sizes where possible such as images
        and scripts. Additionally, I implemented caching mechanisms to enhance
        loading speed and reduce server requests. By utilizing browser caching,
        I instructed visitors' browsers to store certain files locally so that
        subsequent visits to the website would require fewer resources to load.
        <br />
        Furthermore, I optimized the website for different devices and screen
        sizes by employing responsive design techniques. This ensured that users
        accessing the gallery from various devices would have an optimal viewing
        experience, thus ensuring compatibility across different web browsers.
        Throughout this process, I maintained open communication with Richard to
        ensure that his expectations were met; Aiming to create a website that
        not only met Richard's requirements but also provided an enjoyable and
        seamless user experience.
